## Application Overview
This interactive application serves as a dual-purpose visualizer, designed to demystify complex algorithms through engaging and intuitive visualizations. Built using React, it leverages the library's efficient update and rendering capabilities to deliver a seamless user experience. The application is divided into two main components: the Searching Visualizer and the Sorting Visualizer.

## Searching Visualizer
The Searching Visualizer brings to life the mechanics of two fundamental searching algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). Implemented on a grid, this visualizer allows users to visually trace the algorithm's pathfinding process in real-time. Users can set start and end points on the grid, observe how each algorithm approaches pathfinding differently, and gain insights into their operational intricacies. This visual component not only aids in understanding the theoretical aspects of BFS and DFS but also demonstrates their applications in solving real-world problems.

## Sorting Visualizer
Complementing the searching visualizer, the Sorting Visualizer is equipped with implementations of four essential sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort. This feature provides a dynamic visualization of the sorting process, enabling users to see how each algorithm organizes data step by step. By visualizing these algorithms, users can compare their efficiency, understand their mechanics, and appreciate the nuances that make each algorithm unique.
